# the commit and the tag, and pushes both. GitHub Actions then builds the APK
# files and makes the GitHub Release, and the app on the tablet finds it:
# Settings, Help, "Check for updates".
#
# Usage:
#   tools/release.sh <version> ["what changed"]
#
#   version        like 0.1.1. It must be higher than the one in the build file.
#   what changed   one line for the release notes. Leave it out if you have
#                  already written a "## <version>" part in docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md.
#
# Example:
#   tools/release.sh 0.1.1 "The reader no longer opens on a blank page."
