/**
 * Keeps the app quick, by telling on anything that makes it slower.
 *
 * The owner finds the app quick and wants it to stay that way. There is no
 * profiler on the tablet, so the log is where slowness has to show up, the
 * first time it happens and not after someone notices. Two things write there:
 *
 * - A time budget for each moment the user waits for: the start of Home, a
 *   change of tab, opening a book or a note. A moment over its budget writes
 *   one line that starts with "Slow:". See [check] and [Budget].
 * - In a debug build, Android's StrictMode watches the main thread. Disk or
 *   network work there stalls the screen, and each place in this app that
 *   does it writes one line, once per run. The few places that do it on
 *   purpose are listed in [ON_PURPOSE] and write at a lower level.
 *
 * The rules that keep new code from adding slowness are in `CLAUDE.md`, and
 * `SpeedRulesTest` fails the build when code breaks one of them.
 * `docs/decisions/0017-speed-budget.md` has the reasoning and the numbers.
