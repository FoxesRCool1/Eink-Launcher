 * Turns the screen, and hides the Android status bar, for every activity.
 *
 * Both have to be right before the first frame. A window that opens upright
 * and then turns is two full repaints on e-ink, and a status bar that shows
 * and then goes is two more. So the settings are read once, blocking, the
 * first time a window asks, and kept in memory after that. The read is one
 * small file and the log says how long it took.
 *
 * Every activity declares `orientation|screenSize` in the manifest, so a turn
 * does not build the activity again. The open book and the half written note
 * stay as they are, and Compose lays the screen out again at the new size.
