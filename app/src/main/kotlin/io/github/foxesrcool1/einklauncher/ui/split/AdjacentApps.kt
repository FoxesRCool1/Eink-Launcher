/**
 * Another app beside this one: Android's own split screen.
 *
 * An app from Apps, chosen in the second half, is asked to open beside the
 * page in the first half. From Android 12L on, the intent flag
 * FLAG_ACTIVITY_LAUNCH_ADJACENT does that from a full screen app. The
 * emulator, Android 13, does it. Whether this tablet does is up to its
 * firmware: the maker can turn multi-window off. Nobody has tried it on the
 * tablet yet.
 *
 * Android never puts the task of the home screen in a half, and everything
 * this app opens from Home lives in that task. Asked from there, Android made
 * a split with the app in one half and nothing, black, in the other. So the
 * page that should stay on screen first opens again in a task of its own
 * (see [PaneHost.keeper]), and asks for the app from there.
 *
 * When the tablet says no, the flag is simply ignored and the app opens on its
 * own, the same as from the Apps page. The log says what happened.
