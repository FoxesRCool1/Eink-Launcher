/**
 * The task that stands beside another app.
 *
 * Android's split screen takes two tasks, and never the task of the home
 * screen. Everything this app opens from Home lives in that task. So when an
 * app is chosen for the other half, the page that should stay on screen opens
 * again in this task, and asks for the app beside it from there.
 *
 * There is only ever one such task. The manifest gives this activity a task
 * affinity of its own, and each new request clears the old task first, so a
 * day of requests does not leave books and notes open in the background.
 *
 * A page of the launcher, a tab or the choice of pages, shows here, as the
 * second half of a split screen would, with the way back. A book or a note
 * has a screen of its own: this activity starts that screen in the same task
 * and steps out of the way.
