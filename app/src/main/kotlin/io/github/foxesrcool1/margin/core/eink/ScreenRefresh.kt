/**
 * A full refresh that the panel cannot miss: the whole window turns black for
 * a moment, then comes back.
 *
 * The first version only set the vendor picture mode to the full refresh mode
 * and back. On the tablet the owner pressed the button and nothing happened.
 * A picture mode only says how the next change is painted, and a press on a
 * settings row changes almost nothing, so there was nothing to paint.
 *
 * Black over the whole window changes every pixel, and taking it away changes
 * every pixel again. That clears the grey marks on any e-ink panel, with or
 * without vendor control. When the vendor mode can be read, both changes are
 * painted in the full refresh mode, and the old mode comes back after. When it
 * cannot be read, the mode is left alone, because nobody could put it back.
 *
 * One instant change to black and one back. No fade: e-ink rule 1 holds.
