 * and "Reading" and "Offline" can both be true of one app. An app that is
 * uninstalled stays in the file. It comes back into its folders when it is
 * installed again, which is what happens on a restore to a new tablet.
 *
 * The hidden apps live here too, in the same file: an app the user does not
 * want on the A to Z page. It is still installed, still in its folders and
 * still pinned if it was pinned. Hiding is for the twenty preinstalled apps
 * nobody opens, not for a secret.
